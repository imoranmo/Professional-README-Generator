# Professional README Generator
## Overview
For this assignment we were tasked into creating an easy to use readme generator. In this generator users are asked specific questions about their project, including project title, license, contributions, installation, test, email & github handle. Once this information is provided a readme is created for the user with different sections and table of contents.
